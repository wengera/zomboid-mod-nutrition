# Testing pipeline

Automated integration testing of mods on a **real** dedicated server with
**real** driven clients. Design: [pipeline-design.md](pipeline-design.md)
(layers L0–L4, harness mod + python orchestrator, fragility budget, spikes
S1–S7, roadmap T0–T4). Verified facts and measurements per spike:
[spikes.md](spikes.md).

## `pzt` — the orchestrator (`testing/pzt/`)

Run from the repo root with `python testing/pzt <command>` (or `python -m pzt`
from `testing/`). Requires the local game install (path in `pzt/paths.py`).

| Command | What it does | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| `provision --name default` | Fresh server (fixed sandbox: `Zombies=6` = none, override with `--sandbox K=V`), the `admin` client joins, creates the world and its character, quits cleanly; server stops; snapshot → `testing/fixtures/default/` | ~2.5 min, once per game/mod-set version |
| `boot --fixture default [--hold N]` | Restore the fixture's server world into a fresh run dir and start it | ~14 s |
| `attach --fixture default --server 127.0.0.1:27261 --user admin` | Restore that user's client cache, launch the client, wait until it is in-world (no creation screens), ping it | ~35 s |
| `run --fixture default [--hold N] [--clients a,b]` | boot + attach every fixture client + hold (the test slot) + graceful teardown + `report.json`; exit code 0 only with zero non-baseline server errors and no client lua errors | ~1 min + hold |

Every invocation gets its own `testing/runs/<cmd>-<timestamp>/` with
`server-stdout.log`, `server/` (cachedir), `clients/<user>/` (cachedirs incl.
the game's `console.txt`) and `report.json` (timeline + events). Fixture
blobs (`fixtures/*/cache/`) and runs are gitignored; `fixtures/*/fixture.json`
records how a fixture was built (build, mods, sandbox, accounts, timings).

### How a driven client is controlled

- **Launch**: JVM started directly (no UAC prompt) with
  `-nosteam -cachedir <dir> -nosound -novoip [-debug] +connect ip:port`.
  Never `-safemode` (7× slower world load). The `admin` account (bootstrapped
  by the server's `-adminpassword`) runs with `-debug`, which lets the logo
  screen be skipped; other accounts sit through the ~20 s logo.
- **Join + character creation**: the `PZTestKitClient` harness mod (must be in
  the server's `Mods=` — the client reloads Lua with the server's list on
  join) reads `<cachedir>/Lua/pzt-join.txt`, presses CONNECT, and NEXTs
  through spawn/profession/appearance. Restored fixture clients skip creation
  entirely (the character persists server-side).
- **Click to Start**: after loading, `GameLoadingState` waits for a mouse
  click; `pzt` posts one to the client's own window (matched by pid, no
  focus change) until the harness reports `player <user> at x,y,z`.
- **Command bus**: `pzt` writes `<cachedir>/Lua/pzt-cmd.txt` (`seq`, `cmd`),
  the harness executes each seq once and answers in `pzt-ack.txt`. Commands so
  far: `ping`, `quit` (graceful `quitToDesktop`). Test steps will ride on this.
- **Observation**: the client's `console.txt` is tailed for
  `STATE: enter …` transitions and `PZTK:` harness lines.

### Server side

`pzt/server.py` seeds `Server/<name>.ini` (ports, RCON, `Mods=`, `Open=true`,
`UPnP=false`), installs harness mods into the cachedir's `mods/`, starts
`zombie.network.GameServer -nosteam -adminpassword …`, waits for
`*** SERVER STARTED ****`, classifies error-shaped log lines against the
vanilla-noise baseline (stack frames attach to their head line), and stops
with `quit` on stdin (RCON `quit` as fallback).
