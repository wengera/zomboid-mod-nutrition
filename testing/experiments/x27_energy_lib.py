"""x27_energy_lib -- the session engine the Plan 11f Task 5 energy drivers (x271..x275) share: research rows 6-8 (the
36 h fast and the request-level days, the steady eater, six meals against three) on ONE live body over a chain of five
sessions. It is x26_meals_lib.py (Plan 11f Task 4, frozen with x261's run) copied, not imported, with five changes:
  1. the chain: Session(prev_run=<run dir>) copies the previous session's <run>/server into this run's folder and boots
     it with make_server(reuse=True) (research 01-harness-facts s2; ruling S0-2), so the record, the world clock and the
     trail carry over; the client is a fresh fixture restore; the previous session's artifact hands on the meal carry
     and the maintenance kcal;
  2. the replay passes the live server's sleep option (SLEEP_ALLOWED False: the fixture's SleepAllowed and SleepNeeded
     are false, so the record's sleep state is frozen, ruling T4-1) and runs the auto-drink detector as a CHECK only
     (its count is recorded, nothing injected: no fluid container is ever carried, see 4);
  3. the ring adds body.eeDay, body.fm and body.lm (the day's billed expenditure and the composition);
  4. the energy verbs: stop(age) (speed 5 until 5 game minutes before, then speed 1 until the age; the eats run at
     speed 1, so a meal spreads over some game minutes and each eat lands on its own ring row); meal(kind) (research
     s3.7 form 1, the oracles' mapping: the record's body.energyState and the hour read at the stop, the kcal from the
     mod's own kernels on the lupa host (tools/replay_live.py NR_R.requestKcal and NR_R.maint, the same lines the
     tool's request and maint meals call), eaten as whole TKX portions of one per-kcal composition (Mixed650, Mixed217,
     Unit50: mixed(k, water=300 k/650, fibre=6 k/650)), the rounding carried to the next meal (error diffusion, so a
     day's intake stays within about 25 kcal of its targets)); water() (TKX.Water600 and TKX.Water300, 900 g of water
     as food: no container is ever spawned, so the engine's auto-drink (#2770, #2941) has nothing to drink);
  5. run_schedule(): the chain's fixed schedule (SCHEDULE, absolute world ages; world age 0 is 07:00, #2890) run from
     the session's age to its END; a stop already past by under LATE_MAX_H is done at once (late, named), an older one
     is missed (named); nothing is ever moved to make a number prettier.

FROZEN WITH ITS FIRST RUN: once a driver that imports this file has run (x271), this file is never edited (CLAUDE.md
s5). A later change is a new file and the drivers that use it name it.

The engine's phases are x26_meals_lib's: boot (doctor, free memory >= MEM_MIN_GB, the layout lint, the staged
MANIFEST, make_server, the client, the verify rows), S, H, W (the start record at the store's next save), X (the
driver's scenario), R (the ring read-back), D (the departure flush), Z; the slot files; the replay of live over the
ring from W's start record; the artifact copy.

The read-back is the replay's input and the tool is never tuned to a run (Plan 11f Global Constraints).
