"""f_goals -- Plan 23 Task 16d, the LLM session driver: e_day.py's session (one session of a chained survival day on
the driver library) with the survivor's goals chosen by a model. One boot of the profile `agent` (PZTestKit + PZAgent,
one admin -debug client) on the fixture `--fixture` names (default `agent`), the survivor
`Survive(source=LLMSource(ScriptedSource()))` over the PZA/1 file channel, the server's reads off a `PollThread`
(P23-13). The LLMSource (`planner/llm.py`, P23-11, P23-V) runs the `claude` CLI (`DEFAULT_CLI`, model sonnet) on a
worker thread with LLM_TIMEOUT_S, the scripted source standing in for every late, malformed or unsafe answer; the
instincts above the goal branch pre-empt whatever goal runs. Each session's `grade_f1` (gates_f: grade_e1 plus `llm`)
is written at its end.

The driver is thin: its constants, its pre-boot checks (`claude_available` beside the day's), its planner and its
`llm` record. The day's arguments, chain inputs, `Chain` (the library's `Session` with the two hooks) and the boot
(`day.boot_and_run`) are `driverlib/day.py`'s, shared with e_day.py; the rest is the library's (`driverlib/session.py`'s
docstring). The LLMSource's worker is joined after the teardown (out["llm_joined"]; `after_teardown`), so no join
widens the gap between the last kept frame and the server's save, the gap the next session's lineage reads.

PHASES (driverlib.session): hello, damage_hook, kit, loop, as e_day.py's; `on_frame` keeps the session's first frame
for the lineage.
STOPS (out["stop"]): death, bus_dead, lua_error_storm, memory, day_cap (the loop's wall time reaches DAY_CAP_S),
budget (BUDGET_S from the end of the memory gate), error.

THE RECORD: out["loop"] is record.loop_summary's (the action rows with `branch` and a consume's `use`) plus
`Chain.extra_record()`: `goals` (the runner's rows {type, args, state, reason, startS, endS, source}, `source` "llm"
for the model's goal and "scripted" for a stand-in), `night`, `lineage`, `t_loop0_ms` (e_day.py's docstring), and
  llm         {calls (LLMSource.calls, one row per collected call {wall, latency_s, ok, goal, error, prompt_bytes,
              model}, copies), model (DEFAULT_CLI's --model, "sonnet"), cli_version (`claude --version` read once
              in the pre-boot, out["preboot"]["claude_version"]; None when the CLI is absent)}.
`goals.log` (every call's row with its prompt and answer, one JSON line each, beside decision.log) is copied with the
artifact. out["chain"], out["preboot"]["chain_checks"] as e_day.py's; out["preboot"]["claude_available"] {found, path,
version, error, ok}; out["grade_f1"] is gates_f.grade_f1(out), else out["grade_f1_error"]; out["finished"] last.

RULES: never edited after its run (the next pass is a new file); takes only `--session N` (an int >= 1, default 1),
`--fixture NAME` (default agent) and `--prev PATH` (the previous session's artifact JSON, optional), each once; one
live session at a time; free memory gated at MIN_FREE_GB before the boot; never -safemode; launched by the controller
and polled through the persisted artifact; the chain's snapshot between sessions is e_day.py's (`pzt snapshot
--from-run`, chain.snapshot_cmd). The pre-boot checks refuse a dirty agent Lua, agent base, driver library or driver,
a committed artifact of this key, a fixture with no record or cache (or an unreadable one), a --prev that does not
read as an artifact carrying loop.last_frames, a --session that does not follow the fixture's or the prev's session
(session_consistent False, ruling P23-Z) and a `claude` CLI that is not on PATH or does not answer
`claude --version` (an F session without a model is not the reading). The model runs under Angus's own login. Nothing is imported from a frozen driver but `xlib` (and `_dlib`
through the library).
